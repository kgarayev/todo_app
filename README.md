## :page_facing_up: Overview

The Simple Todo App is a basic frontend application built using Vanilla JavaScript. It serves as a platform for managing tasks by allowing users to add and remove tasks, mark them as complete, and filter through the task list. The primary objective of this project was to practice JavaScript skills, and it was developed within a limited timeframe of 2 hours.

## :gear: Functionality

The Simple Todo App offers the following features:

- Task Management: Users can add new tasks to the list and remove existing tasks as needed.
- Task Completion: Tasks can be marked as complete to track progress and differentiate them from pending tasks.
- Task Filtering: The app provides a simple filtering mechanism to display specific subsets of tasks, such as completed tasks or active tasks.

Please note that the Simple Todo App was designed to have minimal functionality and does not include any advanced features or complex styling.

## :rocket: Opportunities for Improvement

While the Simple Todo App fulfills its purpose as a basic task management tool, there are several opportunities for improvement and expansion:

- User Interface Enhancement: Consider adding styling and visual enhancements to create a more appealing and user-friendly interface.
- Additional Functionality: Explore the possibility of incorporating additional features, such as task prioritization, due dates, or task categories, to further enhance the app's usefulness.
- Task Persistence: Implement a mechanism to store tasks using local storage or a backend database, allowing users to access their tasks across multiple sessions.
